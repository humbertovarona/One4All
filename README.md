# One4All
RS232 Physical Port Extender for Virtual Ports


One4All is a very useful application when you have a PC or notebook with only one physical RS232 port and you need the same information in several software. Initially it was created for coastal and ocean navigation, being able to use the GPS information in several navigation software simultaneously, but it can also be used with other RS232 input devices (radars, echo sounders, CTD, etc.) including development boards (Arduino, ESP8266 and other devices that send information through RS232 ports).

This application is used in conjunction with applications that create virtual RS232 ports such as:

• Virtual Serial Port Driver

• com0com

• Free Virtual Serial Ports

• Virtual Serial Port Emulator

• Virtual Serial Port Kit
